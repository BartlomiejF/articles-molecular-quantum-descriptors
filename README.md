This is the code repository for my article ``A study of boosting molecular descriptors with quantum-derived features in prediction of maximum emission wavelengths of chromophores.''
If you would like to reproduce the results download databases from:
[Chromophores database](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/DB_for_chromophore/12045567),
[QM9](http://moleculenet.ai/datasets-1), 
Jupyter Notebooks from this repository and put them in one folder. Run code from the notebooks in order from 0 to 4.
