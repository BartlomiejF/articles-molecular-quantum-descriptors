To reproduce this research do the following steps:

1. Download bioaccumulation database from https://qsardb.org/repository/handle/10967/116
2. Unpack the database named 2014SQER967.qdb.zip into the folder the Jupyter Notebooks are in.
3. Download QM9-extended-plus database from [https://zenodo.org/record/7845173](https://zenodo.org/record/7845173)
4. The Jupyter Notebooks are numbered from 0 to 2. Run the code starting from 0, then 1 and 2.

After running the code, new files should appear in the folder - either plots or datasets.
